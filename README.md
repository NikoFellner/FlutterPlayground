Welcome to **FlutterPlayground**! This repository contains a collection of small projects developed using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and [Dart](https://dart.dev/), primarily as a learning exercise.

> 🧠 **Inspired by the [Flutter & Dart - The Complete Guide by Dr. Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/)** on Udemy.  
These projects are either direct implementations or heavily inspired by challenges and examples from that course.
